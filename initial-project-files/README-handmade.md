Unit 07 project for the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. This project utilizes React to create n image gallery app. With the help of this powerful 'MVC' (model, view, controller) library, the app was built in the style of modern single-page applications to keep it fast and modular.



## How It's Made

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React



## Optimizations

I spent a lot of time working on managing errors. There's even a server test error page if you navigate to '/error'


## Lessons Learned

Picked up a bunch of skills including:
 * Best practices of working with React:
    * Use JSX to write markup-like syntax directly in my JS files.
    * Manage state in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components.
    * React-supportive tools: Create Ract App and React Router modules.
 * Built out gallery components in modular fashion.
 * Practiced using the Fetch API to diplay images.
 * Practice adding logic for search requirements.
 *



## Extra Features

* Cusomized package.json file so that running 'npm start' will run the app.
* Renders helpful PUG templates in the error-handling middleware.
  * When the status property is a 404, a 'page-not-found.pug' template is rendered.
  * For any other status code, the 'error.pug' template is rendered.
* Structure, style and CSS were updated:
  * Updated font to Lexend to improve readability. Learn more: https://www.lexend.com/
  * Favicon update to a little star.
  * Background for sidebar updated.
  * All image and button borders are a little round.
